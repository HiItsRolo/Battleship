<h1> Battleship Rules </h1>
<p>
Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid.
Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or
vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship.
The ships cannot overlap so that only one ship can occupy any given square on the player's
board. The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. They are one each of
the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Carrier (size=5)</li>
  <li>Battleship (size=4)</li>
  <li>Destroyer (size=3)</li>
  <li>Submarine (size=3)</li>
  <li>Patrol Boat (size=2)</li>
</ol>

<h5> Super Powers: </h5>
<ul>
  <li>Send 3 torpedoes in one turn. (torpedos at different locations)</li>
  <li>Send a big torpedo (a torpedo of size 5, with the shape of a + (middle, left, right, up, down)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each player can use one of the 2 super powers once per game. They are enabled only if the
player has 2 ships left on the board. </p>
